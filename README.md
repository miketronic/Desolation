## Introduction

My first wireless keyboard design, currently on version 3 after some extensive updates.

The image on the board was generating by DeepAI.org using the 'Fantasy World Generator'.  The prompt used was 'a post-apocalyptic city with undead birds', it took probably close to 100 tries to get the image I wanted.

### Goals/highlights for this build -

  1. Customizable for those who currently use (or want to try dropping down to) four or three columns.  Additionally, if you decide you want to hit the undo button, you can solder the removed columns back on by bodging with the through-holes.
  2. Small 200mAh battery provides a long usage time of weeks before needing to recharge, and hides easily within the case.
  3. Went with a post-apocalyptic feel, with the name of the boad, the silkscreen, and the chunky power switch...oh, and I'm a big fan of birds.




## Keycaps

As noted in the *Features*, I chose a narrower keyswitch spacing and thus they require narrower keycaps.  CFX keycaps are commercially available from Chosfox, or you can print your own, for which I've included files in the keycaps folder.  They easily print upside down on an FDM printer, and I use a textured baseplate.



## Miscellaneous Notes
